/**
  Define an assertion that will throw an exception if the condition is not
  met. Ember build tools will remove any calls to `Ember.assert()` when
  doing a production build. Example:

  ```javascript
  // Test for truthiness
  Ember.assert('Must pass a valid object', obj);
  // Fail unconditionally
  Ember.assert('This code path should never be run')
  ```

  @method assert
  @param {String} desc A description of the assertion. This will become
    the text of the Error thrown if the assertion fails.
  @param {Boolean} test Must be truthy for the assertion to pass. If
    falsy, an exception will be thrown.
